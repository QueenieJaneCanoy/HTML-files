            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, I'm Queenie Jane Canoy, a third-year student in Information Technology While I may not be the most advanced student in the field, my journey in IT has been filled with curiosity, determination, and a strong desire to learn.
                 a passionate and dedicated student with a strong interest in web development and Information Technology. I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Information technology at Western Mindanao State University. My journey in the world of programming and technology began when I was in Senior High School, and it has been an exciting adventure ever since.</p>
            <p>I've had the opportunity to explore various programming languages, and web development frameworks. I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges in the field of technology. My course has provided me with a solid foundation in algorithms, data structures, and software design. Additionally, I've honed my skills in front-end and back-end web development, and I'm well-versed in languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python. My goal is to continue expanding my knowledge and skills in web development, with a focus on creating innovative and user-friendly solutions for real-world problems.</p>
