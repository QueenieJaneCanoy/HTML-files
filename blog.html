            <h2>What Google’s trial means for the company — and your web browsing</h2>
            <p>Which search engine do you use, and why is it Google? A judge will soon decide.</p>
            <img src="images/google.jpg" alt="Google and web">
            <p>
                The first big trial of the modern Big Tech antitrust movement is here: 
                On September 12, the Department of Justice’s lawsuit against Google’s search engine monopoly began. 
                What’s at stake? Oh, nothing much — just the future of the internet. Or maybe the future of antitrust law in the US. Maybe both.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the first antitrust trial that goes after a Big Tech company’s business practices since the DOJ took on Microsoft in the late ’90s, and it’s the first in a set of antitrust lawsuits against dominant tech platforms from federal and state antitrust enforcers that will play out in the next few months. 
                Those include the DOJ and state attorneys general’s lawsuits against Google over its ad tech business, the FTC’s case against Meta over its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, and the FTC’s lawsuit against Amazon over its marketplace platform. 
                Apple might even catch a lawsuit, too. The outcomes of these cases, starting with this one, will tell us if our antitrust laws, written decades before the internet existed and tried before an increasingly business-friendly justice system, can be applied to dominant digital platforms’ business practices now.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first part of this isn’t in dispute. If you’re like 90 percent of Americans, it’s Google, which has been synonymous with internet search for decades.
                The “why” is where the fight is. Google says it’s because it’s the best search engine out there. 
                The DOJ and attorneys general from almost every state and territory in the country say it’s because Google pays a host of companies — everyone from Apple to Verizon — billions of dollars a year to make its search the default on the vast majority of devices and browsers.

            <h2>The Biggest Announcements at Meta Connect and What it All Means for the Future of XR</h2>
            <img src="images/meta.jpg" alt="meta connect">
            <p>
                Meta Connect 2023 has wrapped up, bringing with it a deluge of info from one of the XR industry’s biggest players. 
                Here’s a look at the biggest announcements from Connect 2023, but more importantly, what it all means for the future of XR.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last week marked the 10th annual Connect conference, and the first Connect conference after the Covid pandemic to have an in-person component. 
                The event originally began as Oculus Connect in 2014. Having been around for every Connect conference, it’s amazing when I look around at just how much has changed and how quickly it all flew by. 
                For those of you who have been reading and following along for just as long—I’m glad you’re still on this journey with us!
            </p>
            <p><b>Meta Quest 3</b>
             <p>Obviously, the single biggest announcement is the reveal and rapid release of Meta’s latest headset, Quest 3. You can check out the full announcement details and specs here and my hands-on preview with the headset here. The short and skinny is that Quest 3 is a big hardware improvement over Quest 2 (but still being held back by its software) and it will launch on October 10th starting at $500.
                Quest 3 marks the complete dissolution of Oculus—the VR startup that Facebook bought back in 2014 to jump-start its entrance into XR. 
                It’s the company’s first headset to launch following Facebook’s big rebrand to Meta, leaving behind no trace of the original and very well-regarded Oculus brand.</p>
